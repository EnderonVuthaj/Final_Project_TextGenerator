## Checkpoint 2

Challenges Faced:

-> Determining appropriate input for my nengo model.

-> Understanding what is happening within each layer which caused problems in training the system.

-> Correctly deternime the arguments of each layer within my model.


Adjustments Made:


-> Assumed the format of the input in my model is correct and optimal for training.

-> Added a minibatch after the model.

-> Made assumptions on the number of optimal layers and that the model is connected properly.


Path Forward:

-> Experiment with different inputs and hyperparameters for optimal performance.

-> Go to EI more. Meet with instructor Mello since that is his specialty.

-> Possibly lower the datapoints and lower accuracy so my system runs.



## Checkpoint 1

Challenges Faced:

-> Determining appropriate dimensions for each layer.

-> Determining the vocabulary size accurately.

-> Integrating tokenization correctly, so it works correcrtly within the Nengo model.


Adjustments Made:


-> Assumed dimensions and vocabulary size and loss functions will be optimal for training the system.

-> Handled tokenization separately using external libraries.

-> Made assumptions on the number of optimal layers.


Path Forward:

-> Experiment with different dimensions and vocabulary sizes and hyperparameters for optimal performance.

-> Work on Nengo model early on, so I can get help if needed.

-> Continue refining the model iteratively based on performance feedback.
